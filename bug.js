This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This is common when using asynchronous operations like `useEffect` hooks.  For example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') */}
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

The `data` variable is initially `null`.  The `fetch` call is asynchronous, meaning the `setData` function isn't executed immediately.  If the component renders before the data is fetched, accessing `data.name` throws an error because `data` is still `null`.
